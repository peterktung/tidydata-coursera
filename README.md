##Course project for "Getting and Cleaning Data"

This script will clean and tidy a set of data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.  

The raw data contains signals (features) obtained from a group of subjects doing a set of activities.

The generated data set represents the average of a subset of features for each activity and each subject.

To execute the script:

1. Download: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
2. Unzip and clone this repo in the unzipped directory
3. Make the unzipped directory the working directory
4. Source the file 'run_analysis.R'

The result will be produced in a file named 'subjectActivityMean.txt'
